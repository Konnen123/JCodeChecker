A java application that evaluates basic aspects of code quality within a small codebase using JavaFX.

To run the app you need to have JavaFX installed.

Steps to download JavaFX:

1.Download and install JavaFX SDK: If your JDK does not include JavaFX (which is often the case with JDK versions 11 and later), you need to download and install the JavaFX SDK separately. You can download it from the official OpenJFX website: https://openjfx.io/.

2.Add JavaFX libraries to your project: Once your project is created, you need to add the JavaFX libraries to it. Follow these steps:

	Go to File > Project Structure....

	Under Project Settings, select Libraries.

	Click the + button.

	Navigate to the directory where you installed JavaFX SDK and select the lib folder.

	Click OK to add the library.
